# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to specificity.  When multiple CSS rules target the same element with high specificity (IDs and classes), the order of precedence can be unpredictable leading to unexpected styling results. This is likely due to subtle differences in how browsers handle the cascade algorithm, and not a formal error.
