One way to resolve this issue is to improve selector specificity and be as explicit as possible to remove any ambiguity.  Another way is to use the `!important` flag, but this is generally discouraged due to its potential negative impact on maintainability and making debugging harder.

Here's a revised CSS code that utilizes the most explicit selectors (although `!important` is generally advised against):

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class div {
  color: red; 
}

#some-id div {
  color: green; 
}

#some-id.special-class div{
  color: purple; 
}
```

The best approach is to refactor your CSS to avoid the need for such potentially ambiguous situations.  Use a CSS methodology like BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) to create more maintainable and predictable CSS code.  This helps to improve clarity and predictability, solving many cascading style sheet related problems.
